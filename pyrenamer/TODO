URGENT TODO

	* End saving patterns:
		- Direct save
		- Remember default combo option

	* Undo last rename:
		- Use a list with the changes
		- Display a window before undoing with the changes?

	* Check dir rename

	* Fix exceptions causing apport to report bugs on launchpad

	* Postpone hachoir for 0.7 instead of 0.6

	* New icon

	* Update translations


OTHERS TODO

	* Remember last entered patterns
	* Drop gconf (better using text files, so pyrenamer con run on Windows)
	* Add support from other music formats (ogg, ape, etc.)
	* Undo option
	* Reload folder

	* Rename folder
	* Move files to another directories (target/$1)
	* Add support for 1 char/number pattern, or to define just a number
	  of chars, something like char{3} or {#4} for 4 numbers.
	* Keep extensions while renaming

	* Unicode problems:
		- For example, if I have the file "Episódio 2.srt", I can use the pattern
		  '{X} {C}.srt' but not 'Episódio {C}.srt'.
